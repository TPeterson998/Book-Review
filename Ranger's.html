        <h2>General Description</h2>
        <p>The Ranger's Apprentice book series was written by John Flanagan. This book series follows the adventures of
            Will Treaty and takes place mainly in Araluen and the suroding countries. The books are set so each
            adventure is one or two
            books long that are around three hundred to four hundred pages. I would definitely recommend this series to
            people because of the adventure, action, and witty humor. However one thing that might discourage people is
            this series is thirteen books long with a fourteenth one coming out soon. Also there are two other series
            that are set in the same world that make references to the Ranger’s Apprentice books.
        </p>
        <h2>Adventure 1(Books 1-4) </h2>
        <p>This is the longest adventure that Will has and also the first. In the first book Will becomes a ranger’s
            apprentice and is trained by the most famous Ranger Halt. Halt is the ranger who in the past defeated
            Morgarath the evil baron who tried to take control of Araluen. Morgarath sends the Kalkara ,beast like
            assassins, to kill Halt and Will must run to get help in order to save Halts life. In book two Will, Horace
            (Will’s childhood enemy turned friend), and Gilan (Halt’s old apprentice) go to get help in the war against
            Morgarath in Celtica. In Celtica they find no help but they do find a girl named Evanlyn and a bridge that
            will let Morgarath to abush the troops from Araluen and in attempts to burn the bridge Will and Evanlyn get
            captured by Scandians. </p>
